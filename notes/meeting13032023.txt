Meeting with advisors Ahmed Zerouali & Ruben Opdebeeck 13/03/2023@1500u

Discussion points:
	- AST-library: This is not an AST anymore but an enriched AST. It has layers, path and (hopefully) a general abstraction for package managers
	- Churn smells: this is more low-churn smells. These include these things like COPY . . in the more general case. Make sure to cover this one at least
			and check other package managers for such smells. (e.g., if you know that it is an NPM application, then you copy json.lock etc first 
			to do the proper installing, could be generalized.). 
			Thougt: Enrich the AST with the kind of application that is run.
	- Background division was ok - can start writing


Program:
	- Does it matter where the extracted file ends up? It's not like when something is extracted that it's going to be a temporary file?
