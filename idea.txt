Idea for analyzing temporary file smell.

Have the commands ordered per layer, every command has info on where it
taps into the AST. Compare layer number and position to get order.

List of lists - list of commands in earliest layer in earliest slot etc ...

Go through list of lists - keep track of files in state. (how files
downloaded with grep etc...?)

//TODO
- TD Low churn instructions
- DL3059 - Consecutive RUN instructions --- && means intentional multiple run AND --mount flag (figure out)
- DL 3010 (case where COPY and Extract happens, should be replaced with ssingle ADD statement)
    - case where COPY introduces tarball/compressed file to image
- DL 4001 -- either use wget or curl, but not both
