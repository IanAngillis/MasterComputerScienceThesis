Idea for analyzing temporary file smell.

Have the commands ordered per layer, every command has info on where it
taps into the AST. Compare layer number and position to get order.

List of lists - list of commands in earliest layer in earliest slot etc ...

Go through list of lists - keep track of files in state. (how files
downloaded with grep etc...?)
