Idea for analyzing temporary file smell.

Have the commands ordered per layer, every command has info on where it
taps into the AST. Compare layer number and position to get order.

List of lists - list of commands in earliest layer in earliest slot etc ...

Go through list of lists - keep track of files in state. (how files
downloaded with grep etc...?)

//TODO
- TD Low churn instructions- DL 4001 -- either use wget or curl, but not both


//TODO -- 

1. Write system to get files that have weren't detected by both systems.
2. Write detection for the low-churn system
3. Cross check the files for which the smells give a different amount
4. Check any way to have better detection for temp smells
